## Contribution
### Background
Using sensor
fusion, the information from the sensors and the characteristics
of each sensor can be used together to improve the estimate
and decrease the uncertainty of the measured variables.


### Solution
In this
paper a real-time pose estimation algorithm using sensor fusion of
visual odometry (optical flow), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements is presented.


### Result
