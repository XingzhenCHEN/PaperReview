## Contribution

Compared with uniform sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)-based solution


### Background

planning solution:1.sampling based RRT/RRT*/PRM 2.graph based. A*

the existing research outcomes cannot be properly
applied to realize efficient GNN-format motion planner because of
the fundamental algorithmic difference

Just focus on the GNN explorer.
