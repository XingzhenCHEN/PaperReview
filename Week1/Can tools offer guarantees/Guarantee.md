## Contribution




### Background

1.AVs have all the complexities of traditional automotive systems

2.they operate in complex environments that present a huge variety of possible traffic scenarios.There are lots of edge cases.

3.this complex environment is sensed through numerous modalities. That means there are many ML and AI black-box.

**We need a mathmetic tools to check the safty!!**


### Solution

Formal Modeling and Specification

a domain-specific probabilistic programming language for modeling the environments of AVs---Scenic

Verification and Testing

in the open-source VerifAI toolkit: 

SYNTHESIS:

oracleguided inductive synthesis (OGIS), which is also termed oracle-guided learning

RUNTIME ASSURANCE

Runtime Monitoring AND Safe Fallback and Switching

introspective environment modeling (IEM)



### Result

This paper is a summary article. And it mainly summarize the four tools to make sure the AVs safty.







## Questions(articles links)
1.D. J. Fremont et al., “Scenic: A language for scenario specification and
scene generation,” in 40th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming
Language Design and Implementation (PLDI),

2.VerifAI

3.Combining induction, deduction, and structure for verification and synthesis

(RV), October 2019, pp. 15–26.



## Reflection

Maybe I can use some of the tools to check the robot safty.
