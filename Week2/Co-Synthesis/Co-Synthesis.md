## Contribution
1.we highlight and analyze the interconnections between software-level methods (e.g. priority assignment and task allocation) and hardware design

2.we propose an optimization framework to produce high-quality synthesized solutions of both software and hardware design based on a set of candidate design methods. 







### Background

In this paper, we discuss the limitations of the traditional design methods with the above requirements enforced, in which hardware and software design are often considered separately.

Traditional design methods are no longer sufficient due to the limitation that hardware and software (H/S) designs are often considered separately.






### Solution


Based on the H/S interconnections, we propose a multi- objective H/S co-synthesis and co-optimization framework to deliver complete H/S co-design solutions for a given system.

two major processes:

1) analyzes the system specifi- cation to obtain a set of optimization objectives and constraints

2) iterates each candidate design method to find its compatible solutions in other design components








### Result


For example, the RTA and CAN analysis described in Section II can be integrated together to compute latency when design methods of software, processors and bus are synthesized.






## Questions(articles links)

We will establish the described H/S interconnections, implement the proposed optimization framework and evaluate its efficacy against the traditional system design approach.
